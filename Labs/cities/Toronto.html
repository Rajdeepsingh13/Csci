Toronto, the capital of the province of Ontario, is a major Canadian city 
along Lake Ontario’s northwestern shore. It's a dynamic metropolis with
 a core of soaring skyscrapers, all dwarfed by the iconic, free-standing CN 
Tower. Toronto also has many green spaces, from the orderly oval of Queen’s 
Park to 400-acre High Park and its trails, sports facilities and zoo.
